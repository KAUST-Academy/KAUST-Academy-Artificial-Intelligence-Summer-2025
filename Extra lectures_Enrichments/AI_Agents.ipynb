        "\n",
        "In this lab, we’ll learn how to build **AI assistants** step‑by‑step, starting from a simple chatbot and turning it into a powerful agent that can actually **do things**.\n",

        "## 🧠 Step 1: Using a Language Model (LLM)\n",
        "A **Language Model** is a type of AI trained to understand and write text.  \n",
        "We’ll use **Google Gemini** (through a library called LangChain) so the AI can:\n",
        "- Understand your questions.\n",
        "- Give answers in natural language.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of it like a very smart \"text predictor\" — like when your phone guesses the next word, but much more advanced.\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 💬 Step 2: Making a Chatbot with Memory\n",
        "We’ll turn the LLM into a **chatbot** — an AI that can hold a conversation.\n",
        "- **Without memory**: It forgets what you said before.\n",
        "- **With memory**: It remembers earlier messages and responds like a real person.\n",

        "We’ll give it **tools** so it can **take action**:\n",
        "1. **Calculator Tool** → So it can solve math problems accurately.\n",
        "2. **Python Tool** → So it can run small programs and calculations.\n",
        "3. **SQL on DataFrame Tool** → So it can search and analyze data stored in tables.\n",

        "Sometimes the AI doesn’t know the answer from memory.  \n",
        "With **RAG**, it can **look up information in a set of documents** before answering.\n",
        "- We’ll store our documents in **Chroma**, a special database for searching text.\n",
        "- The AI will search for the most relevant pieces, then use them to give an accurate answer.\n",
        "\n",

            "1.  **Maintain a Low Volume:** Keep conversations, discussions, and group work at a low, respectful volume.\n",
            "2.  **Headphones Required:** All audio (music, videos, lectures, online calls) must be listened to through headphones, and at a volume that cannot be heard by others.\n",
            "3.  **Silence/Vibrate Phones:** Set mobile phones to silent or vibrate. Take calls outside the study room to avoid disturbing others.\n",
            "4.  **No Loud Activities:** Avoid activities that generate excessive noise, such as loud typing, tapping, shuffling, or repetitive movements.\n",
            "\n",
            "**II. Food & Drink:**\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Covered Drinks Only:** Beverages are usually allowed, but must be in spill-proof containers (e.g., travel mugs, water bottles).\n",
            "2.  **No Messy or Odorous Food:** Avoid bringing in food with strong smells (e.g., certain takeout, fish, pungent cheeses) or food that is messy or crunchy (e.g., chips, highly crumbly items).\n",
            "3.  **Clean Up After Yourself:** Dispose of all trash in designated bins and wipe up any spills immediately. Leave the space clean for the next user.\n",
            "4.  **No Alcohol or Illegal Substances:** These are universally prohibited.\n",

            "**III. Space Usage & Respect:**\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Reservations (If Applicable):**\n",
            "    *   Adhere to reservation times. Arrive promptly and vacate the room when your time slot ends.\n",
            "    *   Don't \"squat\" in a room if it's reserved by someone else.\n",
            "    *   Cancel reservations if you no longer need the room to free it up for others.\n",
            "2.  **First-Come, First-Served (If Not Reservable):** If rooms are not reservable, they are typically available on a first-come, first-served basis.\n",
            "3.  **Don't Monopolize Space:** Only use the space you need. Don't spread belongings across multiple seats or tables if others need space.\n",
            "4.  **No Unattended Belongings:** Do not leave personal items unattended for extended periods to \"hold\" a room or spot. Items left unattended may be removed by staff for security or to allow others to use the space.\n",
            "5.  **Take All Belongings:** Ensure you gather all your personal items, trash, and study materials when you leave.\n",
            "6.  **No Sleeping:** Study rooms are for active study, not for sleeping.\n",
            "7.  **Respect Furniture & Equipment:** Do not deface, damage, or move furniture unnecessarily. If you move it, return it to its original configuration before leaving. Report any damage.\n",
            "8.  **No Vandalism:** Writing on walls, tables, or equipment is strictly prohibited.\n",
            "9.  **Appropriate Conduct:** Engage in respectful and appropriate behavior. Disruptive, harassing, or offensive conduct is not allowed.\n",
            "\n",
            "**IV. General & Safety:**\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Fire Safety:** Do not block exits or prop open fire doors.\n",
            "2.  **Personal Safety:** Be aware of your surroundings and do not leave valuables unattended.\n",
            "3.  **Report Issues:** Notify staff of any issues, such as broken equipment, spills, or disruptive behavior.\n",
            "4.  **Follow Staff Instructions:** Always comply with requests or instructions from facility staff.\n",
            "5.  **Guest Policy:** Some institutions may have policies regarding non-student/non-member guests in study rooms.\n",
